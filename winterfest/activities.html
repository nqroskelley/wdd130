        <h1>Activities</h1>
        <h2>Ice skating</h2>
        <p>We have a very large and spacious ice skating rink, providing plenty of room for experienced ice skaters to display their skills, as well as for beginners to practice their own. Ice skating lessons will be available for all those who wish to learn how to ice skate in a safe environment.</p>
        <h2>Hockey</h2>
        <p>We have a dedicated ice hockey rink that is separate from our more casual ice skating rink. This rink is the perfect size for two full teams to have a competitive match of ice hockey. Spectators welcome.</p>
        <h2>Snowmen</h2>
        <p>Our annual snowman building competition is back and better than ever! This year our judges will be paying extra special attention to detail, and we’ll have awards for several different categories! However, if you aren’t especially interested in competing, that is perfectly fine, because we will also have a dedicated area for casual snowman building that everyone can enjoy.</p>

        <h2>The slopes</h2>
        <p>Our skiing slopes are ready, and they are available for everyone! Whether you want to use skis, snowboards, sleds, or even inner tubes, we have the slopes for you. We have hills that come in three different sizes: First, our smallest hill is the bunny hill that is the best choice for the youngest and least experienced skiing and snowboarding fans, as well as those who wish to have a fun, casual sledding or inner tubing experience. Second, we have a medium sized hill that is great for those with more experience who are looking for some casual fun on skis or snowboards, or for those want to have a faster, more intense time on their sleds or inner tubes. And finally, the largest hill we have is for expert skiers and snowboarders who are looking for the most thrilling experience we have available. Sleds and inner tubes not recommended.</p>
        <h2>Snow angels</h2>
        <p>Back by popular demand, we have the Snow Angel Plains, where everyone can have the opportunity to leave their mark. Once the Winterfest has concluded, the Snow Angel Plains will be photographed from above, and the picture will be made available on our website for all to see.</p>
        <h2>Gingerbread houses</h2>
        <p>New this year is the gingerbread house making competition! Much like the snowman building competition, there will be awards for multiple categories, and plenty of gingerbread for those who just want to have fun.</p>
        <h2>Music</h2>
        <p>Feel like spreading some holiday cheer? Come and sing along with Christmas Carol Karaoke! With both classic Christmas songs of old, along with more modern holiday hits, there will be songs for everyone to enjoy.</p>
        <h2>Refreshments</h2>
        <p>Refreshments, including gingerbread cookies and hot chocolate, will be provided in the lodge at the front gates.</p>

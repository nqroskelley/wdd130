  <h2>Nate</h2>
  <p>Hello everyone! My name is Nathan, I am 27 years old, and I am from Jefferson City, Montana.</p>
  <p>Some activities that I enjoy include reading, swimming, playing video games, and four-wheeling.</p>
  <p>I am pursuing a degree in Professional Studies, and I am happy to be taking this course because I think that having skills in web development can be very useful in a wide variety of fields.</p>
  <p>I grew up in the Church, and I served a mission in Las Vegas, Nevada from 2015-2017.</p>
  <p>One of my favorites scriptures is Doctrine and Covenants 76:22-24, which reads:</p>
  <p>"22 And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</p>
  <p>23 For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Fatherâ€”</p>
  <p>24 That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God."</p>
